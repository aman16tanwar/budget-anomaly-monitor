# Campaign Delivery Monitoring Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines how to implement comprehensive delivery monitoring to detect "zombie campaigns" - campaigns with allocated budgets that cannot actually deliver ads.

## Problem Statement
- **Active campaigns** can have budget but not spend if:
  - All ad sets are paused/inactive
  - Ad sets exist but have no ads
  - All ads are disapproved or paused
- This creates **zombie campaigns** that waste budget allocation
- Current monitoring only checks campaign level, missing delivery issues

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Data Collection Enhancement
Update `meta_api_implementation_bigquery.py` to fetch:
```python
# For each active campaign, also fetch:
- Ad Sets: status, effective_status
- Ads: status, effective_status, approval_status
```

### 2. New BigQuery Tables
```sql
-- Ad Set snapshots
meta_adset_snapshots
- adset_id
- campaign_id
- status
- has_active_ads
- active_ads_count

-- Delivery status
meta_campaign_delivery_status
- campaign_id
- can_deliver
- delivery_issue_type
- active_adsets_count
- deliverable_adsets_count
```

### 3. Delivery Status Categories

| Status | Emoji | Description | Risk |
|--------|-------|-------------|------|
| ACTIVE | ðŸŸ¢ | Has deliverable ad sets with active ads | Low |
| NO_ACTIVE_ADSETS | ðŸ”´ | All ad sets paused/inactive | High |
| NO_ADS | ðŸŸ  | Ad sets active but no ads | High |
| ADS_PAUSED | ðŸŸ¡ | Has ads but all paused | Medium |
| ADS_DISAPPROVED | ðŸ”´ | Ads rejected by Meta | High |

### 4. Alert Enhancements

#### New Anomaly Types:
1. **zombie_campaign_high_budget**
   - Campaign has budget > $5,000 but can't deliver
   - Risk Score: 0.9
   - Alert: CRITICAL

2. **incomplete_setup**
   - New campaign (< 24 hours) with no deliverable ads
   - Risk Score: 0.7
   - Alert: WARNING

3. **delivery_degraded**
   - Campaign lost > 50% of deliverable ad sets
   - Risk Score: 0.6
   - Alert: WARNING

### 5. Dashboard Updates

#### Active Campaigns Tab:
- Add delivery status column with emoji indicators
- Color code rows based on delivery risk
- Show "X/Y ad sets active" count

#### New Zombie Campaigns Tab:
- List all campaigns that can't deliver
- Group by issue type
- Show potential daily budget waste
- One-click actions to investigate

### 6. Implementation Steps

1. **Phase 1: Basic Delivery Check** (Current)
   - Added placeholder delivery column
   - Created zombie campaigns tab
   - Shows high-budget campaigns for manual review

2. **Phase 2: Ad Set Integration** (Next)
   - Update API calls to fetch ad sets
   - Store ad set status in BigQuery
   - Calculate basic delivery status

3. **Phase 3: Full Delivery Analysis** (Future)
   - Fetch ad-level data
   - Check approval status
   - Implement all delivery categories
   - Add automated alerts

### 7. Example Alert Messages

```
ðŸ§Ÿ ZOMBIE CAMPAIGN ALERT
Campaign: Summer Sale 2024
Account: Client ABC
Daily Budget: $15,000
Issue: No active ad sets (all 5 paused)
Days Inactive: 3
Potential Waste: $45,000
Action: Review and activate ad sets or pause campaign
```

### 8. Benefits
- Prevent budget waste on non-deliverable campaigns
- Catch incomplete campaign setups
- Identify technical issues preventing delivery
- Reduce client complaints about non-spending campaigns

### 9. Future Enhancements
- Auto-pause zombie campaigns (with approval)
- Predictive warnings before campaigns become zombies
- Integration with Meta's Delivery Insights API
- Historical zombie campaign analytics
